## Ruby project

This is my first project at codeclan! A project developed one month after signin in.

In this one week project app I was asked to make an app that tracks someone's travel adventure

## My MVP
-   The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
-   The user should be able to create, edit and delete countries
-   Each country should have one or more cities to visit
-   The user should be able to create, edit and delete cities
-   The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see.

## The stack and rules
The project must be built using only:

-   HTML / CSS
-   Ruby
-   Sinatra
-   PostgreSQL and the PG gem

It must  **NOT**  use:

-   Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
-   JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
-   Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
-   Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

## My Idea

When first I was introduced to the theme of the app, the first idea that I had in mind was to make an app for those who want to travel without moving from home :)

So I decided to implement a map where the user would be able to add cities where he want to travel or where he already trevelled.

## Challenges

As I was't allowed to implement any sort of API I had to download a whole database where I could substract data from each country, like capitals, populations, etc...

As you can see in the photo, I decided to make:

 - A database planning (top left).
 - Sort of a wirframe (right side).
 - A plann for the used classes (middle left).

 ## Conclussion

 Making my first project within one month of learning a new environment was really awesome. this project helped me a lot to consolidate al the included technologies like ruby,pSQL,and HTML.
